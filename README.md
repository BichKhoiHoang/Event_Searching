The application is a comprehensive event search platform that allows users to input keywords, yielding a list of matching events. What sets this application apart is its integration of Ticketmaster API for event data, encompassing names, dates, and locations. Additionally, it leverages Weatherbit API to provide weather details on the event date. It's worth noting that due to Weatherbit's 16-day forecast limit, events beyond this range won't yield weather data. Furthermore, the app employs Wikimedia API to retrieve details on event attractions or performers, enhancing the user experience with in-depth event information
